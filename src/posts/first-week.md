Woohoo, we made it! Last week around this time (as I write), I was having cocktail dinner with collegues I had just met. And soon after, I had found myself having to sleep in a room with leaking roof. Feels like all that fiasco was ages ago...

I've finally settled in and have a routine. The coolness of the place hasn't worn out yet! I've gotten to meet amazing people and renowed scientists; the work place ambiance is great; the library I'm sitting in right now feels like a dream; the work is stressful but managable. 

In terms of work, I'm right now reviewing the literature on genetic literacy. I have always despised reading scientific literature back to back, but now I am kinda forced to doing it. I really don't know how scientists do this on a regular basis. I am drowned in ocean of knowledge. I'm yet to come up with a mechanism to take notes and summarize my readings. Right now, I have an Excel sheet (as recommended by Saveetha) where I keep track of information and it's messy. I hope to devise a more efficient system. 

I haven't really had a chance to scicomm work that I have been hear for. Maybe I'll talk to Saveetha next week...
