On a usual day a few years ago, my friend came to school with a brand new sticker on his cycle. "What next?" it said. He jokingly asked that question to me, but I seriously didn't have an answer. I was finishing 10th and had to decide what subjects to take up in 11th standard. Without going into details, I can say that I made last-minute decisions then, and they weren't the best. 

Cut to the present, people have asked me what I like to do next, and not surprisingly, I don't have an answer. I don't have an answer for myself either. Unlike what I did in 10th, I do not want to be taking decisions in haste this time. I have explored a lot more in life -- coding, writing, podcasting, hosting, performing music, etc. I have a wide range of opportunities. My only fear is that these exciting possibilities might remain as possibilities. 

In July, as a part of the [WISR Mentorship Program](https://www.instagram.com/wisrindia/?hl=en), I met Dr Krishna Deepak. In our first meeting, he suggested I start planning the next five years right from now. So, I spent a few hours every week that month jotting down: what I like doing, open positions, courses to apply to, etc. It turned out to be a useful exercise. Instead of my brain, this document would keep track of all the opportunities. I want to keep the planning going. Whenever I find out about an exciting position, learn about an exciting person, or think of a potential collaboration, I hope to add to this blog. The blog would be the equivalent of the "What Next" sticker my friend had.
