I arrived in Bengaluru three days ago. It's been a rollercoaster journey so far. 

With many challenges like redefining lifestyle, making new relationships, learning how the organization functions, figuring out work, etc., I knew it wasn't going to be easy. I made my life miserable for myself by messing up accommodation. 

I don't have a lot of time in hand, but here's a quick breakdown of events: 

On the first day, I learnt how to use podcasting gears, took a stroll around campus and attended a workshop on surveillance where some big names spoke. I felt a bit out of place, but everyone was friendly and welcoming. Thanks to the workshop, I also got to eat fancy food for free. I thought I was up to a good start until I made it to my accommodation. The room had no furniture (which I was aware of). The washroom smelt awful. At this point, I was trying hard not to break down. But I lost when the roof started to leak because of rain. One of the hardest nights. 

The next day -- my official starting day -- I turned up at campus homeless quite literally. I freshened up there and reported. I spent the afternoon doing paperwork and met my PI very briefly. Oh, and I happened to pass by Gagandeep Kang. I was so star-struck seeing her in person. I barely managed to speak. In the evening, I chugged along with my colleague to her PG because 1. I wanted to shower 2. I was scouting for a place to move into. The owner of the PG was hosting a pooja and dinner. I was forced into being a part of it. Here I was, in a brand new city having free dinner at a stranger's place with people I met two days ago. I don't think my life has gotten more absurd than this. 

Yesterday also I was homeless. I spent the first half of the day working in the NCBS lobby area. Such a picturesque place! I was still in disbelief that I got to be there. The rest of the afternoon, I was out with a friend (an experience in itself). 

Making a phone call to the landlord to say I was leaving was the hardest. I knew I was not at fault, but I still felt uneasy. I was feeling miserable, but I got some work done later in the morning. I finally moved into the PG in the afternoon. I'm having to share the space with a couple of people, I hope I survive. 

I've learnt so many life lessons in just three days. I hope I get better at living with experience. All will be well.
