This website never really saw me, did it? Well, I have now graduated. Starting from Sept. 1st, I'm starting as a science communication intern at [Tata Institute of Genetics and Society](https://tigs.res.in/) (TIGS), Banglore! I'll be working with [Saveetha Meghanathan](https://tigs.res.in/people/scientists/saveetha-meganathan/) on various [community engagement](https://tigs.res.in/community-engagement/) activities. 

New city, new people, new role, new routine. I'm excited and nervous. I don't have any specific expectations except to learn new skills, contribute constructively to the projects, and, well, survive. 

And at least this time, I hope to document my experience more systematically. Good luck to me!
